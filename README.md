# CodeJam.Light
This is personal repository for the future versions of (CodeJam)[https://github.com/rsdn/CodeJam] project

CodeJam.Light project aims to ressurrect and to actualize the CodeJam library

## What is CodeJam?
CodeJam is not a framework. The library does not try to influencethe code style
or architecture of your project. Instead, we provide a set of helpers that
cover missing functionality in the .Net BCL and eases code development.

## What are our goals?

* No new concepts. We do follow well-established BCL code style and try
to follow least surprise design principle.
* Doogfoofing. Every and each helper to be included in the library
has to be used in real projects and has to show it efficiency.
* Wide targeting range. We use the [Theraot.Core](https://github.com/theraot/Theraot/) library to
support all .net versions starting with .Net 3.1
(technically, we may support .Net 2.0 but we have no test pipeline for that).
